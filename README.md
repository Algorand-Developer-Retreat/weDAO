# weDAO 🪐

A fully open-source, lightweight DAO framework built on **Algorand** — designed for any community to launch and manage on-chain proposals with their own token.

This project is structured for modularity and ease-of-use, featuring a **frontend interface** and **smart contracts**, both of which are configurable and reusable for any Algorand-based DAO.
